## Exercise 1
Our solution for the first homework can be found in the todo-list directory. 
To make it easier to develop and deploy on our computers we decided to port
the given example code into the hello world example project structure (yarn + 
single file components) of the vue-cli project. This allows us to manage 
dependencies easily and gives us also the opportunity to try TypeScript as this
is a preconfigured choosable variant from the vue-cli tool.

Trying the code is as easy as going into the todo-list dir and calling 
`yarn install` followed by `yarn serve`. If not already installed you obviously
have to install yarn before doing that :).
